title: Salient Point and Scale Detection by Minimum Likelihood
abstract: We propose a novel approach for detection of salient image points and estimation
  of their intrinsic scales based on the fractional Brownian image model.  Under this
  model images are realisations of a Gaussian random process on the plane. We define
  salient points as points that have a locally unique image structure. Such points
  are usually sparsely distributed in images and carry important information about
  the image content. Locality is defined in terms of the measurement scale of the
  filters used to describe the image structure.  Here we use partial derivatives of
  the image function defined using linear scale space theory. We propose to detect
  salient points and their intrinsic scale by detecting points in scale-space that
  locally minimise the likelihood under the model.
