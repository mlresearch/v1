title: Gaussian Process Approximations of Stochastic Differential Equations
abstract: 'Stochastic differential equations arise naturally in a range of contexts,
  from financial to environmental modeling. Current solution methods are limited in
  their representation of the posterior process in the presence of data. In this work,
  we present a novel Gaussian process approximation to the posterior measure \emphover
  paths for a general class of stochastic differential equations in the presence of
  observations. The method is applied to two simple problems: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  process, of which the exact solution is known and can be compared to, and the double-well
  system, for which standard approaches such as the ensemble Kalman smoother fail
  to provide a satisfactory result. Experiments show that our variational approximation
  is viable and that the results are very promising as the variational approximate
  solution outperforms standard Gaussian process regression for non-Gaussian Markov
  processes.'
