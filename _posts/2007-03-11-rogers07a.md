title: Multi-class Semi-supervised Learning with the e-truncated Multinomial Probit
  Gaussian Process
abstract: Recently, the null category noise model has been proposed as a simple and
  elegant solution to the problem of incorporating unlabeled data into a Gaussian
  process (GP) classification model. In this paper, we show how this binary likelihood
  model can be generalised to the multi-class setting through the use of the multinomial
  probit GP classifier. We present a Gibbs sampling scheme for sampling the GP parameters
  and also derive a more efficient variational updating scheme. We find that the performance
  improvement is roughly consistent with that observed in binary classification and
  that there is no significant difference in classification performance between the
  Gibbs sampling and variational schemes.
