title: Learning RoboCup-Keepaway with Kernels
abstract: We apply kernel-based methods to solve the difficult reinforcement learning
  problem of 3vs2 keepaway in RoboCup simulated soccer. Key challenges in keepaway
  are the highdimensionality of the state space (rendering conventional discretization-based
  function approximation like tilecoding infeasible), the stochasticity due to noise
  and multiple learning agents needing to cooperate (meaning that the exact dynamics
  of the environment are unknown) and real-time learning (meaning that an efficient
  online implementation is required).  We employ the general framework of approximate
  policy iteration with least-squares-based policy evaluation. As underlying function
  approximator we consider the family of regularization networks with subset of regressors
  approximation. The core of our proposed solution is an efficient recursive implementation
  with automatic supervised selection of relevant basis functions. Simulation results
  indicate that the behavior learned through our approach clearly outperforms the
  best results obtained with tilecoding by Stone et al. (2005).
