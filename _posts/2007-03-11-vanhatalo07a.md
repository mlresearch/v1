title: Sparse Log Gaussian Processes via MCMC for Spatial Epidemiology
abstract: Log Gaussian processes are an attractive manner to construct intensity surfaces
  for the purposes of spatial epidemiology. The intensity surfaces are naturally smoothed
  by placing a Gaussian process (GP) prior over the relative log Poisson rate, and
  the spatial correlations between areas can be included in an explicit and natural
  way into the model via a correlation function. The drawback with using a Gaussian
  process is the computational burden of the covariance matrix calculations.  To overcome
  the computational limitations a number of approximations for Gaussian process have
  been suggested in the literature. In this work a fully independent training conditional
  sparse approximation is used to speed up the computations. The posterior inference
  is conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and the sampling of the
  latent values is sped up by a transformation taking into account their posterior
  covariance. The sparse approximation is compared to a full GP with two sets of mortality
  data.
