<h2>Sparse Log Gaussian Processes via MCMC for Spatial Epidemiology</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Log Gaussian processes are an attractive manner to construct intensity
surfaces for the purposes of spatial epidemiology. The intensity
surfaces are naturally smoothed by placing a Gaussian process (GP)
prior over the relative log Poisson rate, and the spatial correlations
between areas can be included in an explicit and natural way into the
model via a correlation function. The drawback with using a Gaussian
process is the computational burden of the covariance matrix
calculations.  To overcome the computational limitations a number of
approximations for Gaussian process have been suggested in the
literature. In this work a fully independent training conditional
sparse approximation is used to speed up the computations. The
posterior inference is conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulations and the sampling of the latent values is sped up by a
transformation taking into account their posterior covariance. The
sparse approximation is compared to a full GP with two sets of
mortality data.
