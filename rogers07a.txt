<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recently, the null category noise model has been proposed as a simple
and elegant solution to the problem of incorporating unlabeled data
into a Gaussian process (GP) classification model. In this paper, we
show how this binary likelihood model can be generalised to the
multi-class setting through the use of the multinomial probit GP
classifier. We present a Gibbs sampling scheme for sampling the GP
parameters and also derive a more efficient variational updating
scheme. We find that the performance improvement is roughly consistent
with that observed in binary classification and that there is no
significant difference in classification performance between the Gibbs
sampling and variational schemes.
