<h3>Abstract</h3>

Stochastic differential equations arise naturally in a range of
contexts, from financial to environmental modeling. Current solution
methods are limited in their representation of the posterior process
in the presence of data. In this work, we present a novel Gaussian
process approximation to the posterior measure <i>over paths</i> for a
general class of stochastic differential equations in the presence of
observations. The method is applied to two simple problems: the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, of which the exact solution is known and
can be compared to, and the double-well system, for which standard
approaches such as the ensemble Kalman smoother fail to provide a
satisfactory result. Experiments show that our variational
approximation is viable and that the results are very promising as the
variational approximate solution outperforms standard Gaussian process
regression for non-Gaussian Markov processes.
