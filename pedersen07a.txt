<h2>Salient Point and Scale Detection by Minimum Likelihood</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

We propose a novel approach for detection of salient image points and
estimation of their intrinsic scales based on the fractional Brownian
image model.  Under this model images are realisations of a Gaussian
random process on the plane. We define salient points as points that
have a locally unique image structure. Such points are usually
sparsely distributed in images and carry important information about
the image content. Locality is defined in terms of the measurement
scale of the filters used to describe the image structure.  Here we
use partial derivatives of the image function defined using linear
scale space theory. We propose to detect salient points and their
intrinsic scale by detecting points in scale-space that locally
minimise the likelihood under the model.
